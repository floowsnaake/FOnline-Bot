Quest Info: http://www.fonline-reloaded.net/wiki/index.php?title=Lifting_caravan_boxes&redirect=no

You have to run iFonline n Window Mode/windowed!
and you need to take a picture of the box in game/screenshot so it doesnt drop anything els in the inventory, it drops what ever is highes up in the inventory so if the bot doesnt pick up the box becuse of lag or something else it might drop something else.
